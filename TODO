AppConfig::State

* compact definition form (e.g. "foo|bar|baz=s@") must be made more robust
  and have it intuit ARGCOUNT from the pattern as well as args

      =[isbf] - nothing to worry about (we're not validating)
      :[isbf] - hmmm....
      !@%     - implies ARGCOUNT
      { } ( ) - ignored for now?
  
  Apart from the @, % or ! that tells us the ARGCOUNT, the rest is only 
  saved (in ARGS) for AppConfig::Getopt to pass to Getopt::Long.

* Perhaps allow a callback to be installed which is called *instead* of
  the get() and set() methods (or rather, is called by them).

* CASE sensitivity may be required on a per-operation basis.  E.g. CASE
  sensitive for AppConfig::Args but CASE insensitive for AppConfig::File.

* AppConfig::State may need to have CMDARG re-introduced.  When using
  blocks, it will be considerably more convenient to say '-v' rather
  than -block_verbose.  The global CMDARG could be a template of the
  form '%c', to indicate the first character, for example.

AppConfig::Getopt

* Complete documentation

Test Suite

* Modify file expansion tests to determine if getpwnam() etc are working
  or not.
